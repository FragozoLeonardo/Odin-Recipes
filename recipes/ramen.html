<h1> Tonkotsu Ramen </h1>

<h3> Method </h3>

<ol>
<li>Wash the bones in cold water with clean brush to remove blood. Put the bones in a strainer to drain the excess water.</li>

<li> In a large pot, add water, bones and kombu. Measure the distance from the top of the pot to the top of the water, make a note of this ‘original water level’.</li>

<li> Cook over high heat to bring to a boil and keep boiling. Stir the stock with a long wooden spatula, scrape the bottom to prevent it from burning and to bring the scams to the surface. Skim the scams until they stop appearing.</li>

<li> Keep boiling the stock for 4 hours, maintain the ‘original water level’ on (2) by periodically topping up the water so it remains the same. Stir the bottom of the pot to prevent it from burning.</li>

<li>When the stock becomes milky and thicker after 4 hours, start reducing the stock. Do not add the water anymore. This is a process of thickening the stock by reduction. Keep boiling the stock until the volume is reduced to about half. During this phase, stirring frequently by scraping the bottom of the pot with the spatula as it can be burnt easily.</li>

<li>Turn off the heat, pour the stock over a strainer to another clean pot. In order to maintain the quality of the stock, it is advisable to cool it rapidly by putting the bottom of the pot into a pool of cold water. Keep the stock in the fridge if stored overnight.</li>

<h3> Char Shu Pork </h3>
